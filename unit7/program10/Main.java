//Exercise 9: (2) Create a class called Root that contains an instance of each of the classes
//(that you also create) named Component1, Component2, and Component3. Derive a
//class Stem from Root that also contains an instance of each “component.” All classes should
//have default constructors that print a message about that class.
//Exercise 10: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that each class only has non-default
//constructors. 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stem stem = new Stem("Stem");
    }
}
